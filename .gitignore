The Silence is Deafening

HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 2:53 PM
Haven't seen that in awhile
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 2:53 PM
I'm a rubyist ha
Rubyist, Pythonista, Rustacean in that order.
Here's that handler for that message you saw in discord bots.

# frozen_string_literal: true

# message events
def messages(bot, _config)
  # dm to bot
  bot.pm do |event|
    event.respond("ack") if event.text.match?(/^syn$/i)
  end
end
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 2:54 PM
ahhhh
See i went to the Java, Javascript, and C# route
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 2:55 PM
sorry no, that's not right. That's if you DM the bot.
# frozen_string_literal: true

# testing hooks
# @param [Discordrb::Bot] bot
# @param [Hash,nil] config
def testing(bot, config)
  # PP: discord-bots, testserver: bots
  channel_ids = config['channels']

  # if the text "syn" is sent to a bot channel, return with an acknowledgement.
  bot.message do |m|
    if channel_ids.include?(m.channel.id)
      # send dm
      # m.author.dm.send_message("ACK") if m.text.match?(/^syn$/i)

      # reply in the channel
      m.channel.send_message("<@#{m.author.id}> ‚Äî **ack**.") if m.text.match?(/^syn$/i)
    end
  end
end
there it is
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 2:55 PM
I was gonna say this didnt look right bot.pm do |event|
I need to look into ruby
that looks like fun
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 2:56 PM
you may not know that a lot of projects were started with Ruby üòä 

GitHub, Twitter, GitLab for starters
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 2:56 PM
Im assuming |m| is just a function?
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 2:57 PM
it's a closure (ruby calls them blocks) but yeah. pretty much
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 2:58 PM
 if channel_ids.include?(m.channel.id) and this im assuming makes sure that it only works in the bot channel, and that channel_ids gets from the config file?
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 2:59 PM
that's right. the config file is just a yaml file

testing:
  channels:
    - 908203959875936288 # PPRP: discord-bots
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:00 PM
if you know one language, you know all XD
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:00 PM
üíØ%
the bot is done, i'm just plugging it into a production server and hooking CI/CD in
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:03 PM
whats the main purpose for it?
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:05 PM
Pretty much anything custom we want.  if-this-then-that.

he's our little helper. Right now he doesn't do too much, but he's got potential ha
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:06 PM
Are yall looking to reduce how many bots yall have? 

Like eventually make it so it does everything that yall currently have on hand
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:07 PM
i mean that's possible, but no. that's not the intent.

I'm picturing random things that the Discord Support may need, or automated logging type stuff.  Discord Support could add a ‚ùó reaction emoji on a message and it would do something like censor it.  whatever
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:08 PM
that makes sense

i vote to keep the bots name as owen jr
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:09 PM
oh that's not changing haha
what sort of stuff have you done / do you do? development wise?
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:12 PM
Used to do a lot with node.js and bot development, but havent touched that in awhile
I also used to make Plugins for minecraft servers, but again, havent done that in awhile either

Right now ive been focusing on front end and backend web development, making websites and such.
My next project as soon as im done with the one for LSPD is gonna be a ticketing system, just for practice
my current project is hosting here (Only domain that i had free)
https://ordertothechaos.com/
still work in progress making it responsive and such
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:17 PM
neat!
did you use a theme or front-end framework, or is this all custom HTML/CSS/JS?
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:17 PM
all Html/css/js
which is why its taking me so long to actually get work done on it
for whatever reason the footer on the handbook page has just completely dissapeared and im unsure why, so i gotta find what happened to it
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:22 PM
looks like the footer is nested in the div.body

# Handbook.html
%html
  %body
    %div.header
    %div.body
      %div.footer
    
# index.html
%html
  %body
    %div.header
    %div.body
    %div.footer
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:25 PM
you are right, theres a extra </div> that i lef it there
actuall that wasnt the problem, i didnt have the Iframe in its own div so it was covering the footer
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/20/2024 3:33 PM
there we go, all better now
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/20/2024 4:01 PM
would love to hear about your journey as you go! Not sure if you intend on making a career out of it, but let's stay in touch.
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/21/2024 11:02 AM
Would you be willing to help me get my FOV set up like yours sometime?
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/21/2024 11:02 AM
absolutly(Edited)
absolutely
Ill be on for another 2 hours, then be off for probably around 2 hours, then be back on the rest of the night
sircapsalot ‚Äî 12/21/2024 11:04 AM
Is it easy enough to link or list the instructions, or do we need to do it via voice
HuiDev ‚Äî 12/21/2024 11:05 AM
Easy enough to list, give me like five minutes

First Launch FiveM and go to settings.
From Settings: 
Settings
  -> Game

Where it says Update Channel, change the build to Latest (Unstable).
Restart Fivem.
After Restarting FiveM, open your F8 Console and type profile_fpsFieldOfView <#>
I would recommend join A server do to this so you can see the effects happening in game.
However due to the announcement by johnny where the AC has issues with people in the latest build I wouldnt recommend joining Phoenix. 
I would also recommend setting it while you are in a vehicle, as it can cause some clipping
HuiDev ‚Äî 1/1/2025 3:51 AM
I've looked into it, if someone more familar with Lua and Fivem can edit this plugin to just include the trunk, i d love to see this, otherwise i wouldnt worry about it. Ive tried to take a look at it, but im very unfamiler with fivepd api and lua
